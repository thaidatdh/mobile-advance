    transcript:
      "Hello, my name is Deborah Kurata, and I'd like to welcome you to my course, Angular: Getting Started, from Pluralsight. This beginner‑level course takes you on a journey through the basic features of Angular. It guides you down the right path, making your own journey with Angular more pleasant and productive. Along the way, we build a sample application so you can code along or use it as a reference for your own development. You'll see how Angular provides a consistent set of patterns for building components, templates, modules, and services, helping you come up to speed quickly. This course covers how to build components, how to create the user interface for your application in a template, and power it up with data binding and directives. You'll discover how to build services for logic needed across components and inject those services where they are needed. You'll learn how to send requests to a web server using HTTP and observables. And you'll see how to set up routing to navigate between the views of your application. In addition, you'll see how to use the Angular command‑line interface, or CLI, to generate, execute, test, and deploy your Angular application. By the end of this course, you will know the basics you need to get started building your own Angular applications. I hope you'll join me on this journey through Angular: Getting Started, from Pluralsight.",

    transcript:
      "Hi everyone. My name is Deborah Kurata. Welcome to my course, Defensive Coding in C#. Great applications help users enter correct data, perform required operations as expected, handle system and application exceptions, and make it easy for future developers to modify and maintain the code. Defensive coding techniques are a set of programming guidelines and habits that will immeasurably improve your code's comprehension, quality, and predictability. Some of the major topics that we will cover include improving your code's comprehension by writing clean code and following techniques such as the single responsibility principle, improving your code's quality through unit tests, and improving your code's predictability by validating method arguments with Guard clauses, handling nulls appropriately, returning predictable results, and managing exceptions. Along the way, we'll explore some of the newer features of C#, including the reference type nullability features in C# 8, the enhanced tuple syntax from C# 7, and the null conditional operator and exception filter syntax from C# 6. By the end of this course, you will learn the techniques you need to protect your code, both now and in the future from the perils of the real world. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn defensive coding techniques with the Defensive Coding in C# course, at Pluralsight.",

Understanding each of them beyond a surface level will help you more deeply understand the foundations of JavaScript. In this course, JavaScript Objects, Prototypes, and Classes, you will learn the foundations of creating and working with objects including a deeper understanding of how JavaScript works with regards to objects and inheritance. First, you will see different ways to create objects and properties and how to work with them, including modifying property descriptors, using constructor functions, working with getters and setters, and more. Next, you will discover what prototypes are, how prototypes and prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript, and some of the hidden complexities of prototypes. Finally, you will explore how to create objects and handle inheritance using classes. When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of JavaScript Objects, Prototypes and Classes needed to create powerful and well structured applications that take advantage of the dynamic power of JavaScript.",

      "Hi everyone. This is Jim Cooper, and welcome to my course on JavaScript Objects, Prototypes, and Classes. I've been working as a software developer for more than 25 years, and I've been a serious JavaScript developer for the past 7 years, and now I'm excited to bring you this JavaScript course on Objects, Prototypes, and Classes. In this course, you'll learn not just about the different ways to create objects, but the deep behind-the-scene things that happen when creating and working with objects and prototypes. Consider prototypes, for example, they're a little mind bending and can be challenging to figure out, but the funny thing is, once you really get prototypes, you'll realize that they're not really that complex. I promise you, you'll understand them deeply when we're done. Some major topics that we'll cover include creating objects with object literals, constructor functions, and classes, working with and configuring object properties, including property getters and setters, a deep behind-the-scenes look into what prototypes really are and how they're used for inheritance, and how to do all of this with JavaScript classes. We'll even take a look at a few built-in JavaScript objects while we're at it. By the end of this course, you'll know everything you need to know about working with objects in JavaScript. Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with basic programming concepts, basic JavaScript syntax, and working with variables. All of this is foundational to working with JavaScript. So let's jump in, and you'll soon start wowing your friends and colleagues with the depth of your knowledge about JavaScript objects, prototypes, and classes.",

      "This course teaches the in-depth, behind-the-scenes details of creating JavaScript objects, manipulating properties, and using prototypal inheritance.",
    transcript:
      "In this course, you'll learn not just about the various ways to create objects in JavaScript and their advantages, but also what's happening behind the scenes. You'll then learn about the surprising amount of power and configurability you may not be aware of with object properties. Finally, when you are finished with this course, you will have a clear and complete understanding of what prototypes are and how to recognize and use prototypal inheritance. With this deeper understanding, you will be able to create powerful and well structured applications that take advantage of the dynamic power of JavaScript.",

Python is a highly dynamic language, and this dynamism is enabled by a great deal of metadata associated with objects at runtime. Coupled with this, Python provides excellent support for introspection, the ability of a program to examine and even modify its own structure and state. In the hands of a skilled programmer, introspection can be the key to elegant designs or debugging complex problems. In this course, we' ll introduce you to Python 's facilities for introspecting live programs. Some of the major topics we'll cover include introspecting type information, introspecting objects, introspecting scopes, Python's standard library \"inspect\" module, applying these concepts to build useful tools. By the end of this course, you'll know how to query objects for their attributes and inspect program state, and you'll have a deeper knowledge of how Python programs are arranged internally.

      "Hi everyone. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to our course, Advanced Python. I'm a principle consultant at Sixty North, and out of the dozen or so programming languages I can choose to use, Python is the one I return to again and again to produce low friction solutions quickly and efficiently. I've been working regularly with Python since the turn of the millennium, using it to solve problems across a wide range of business, scientific, and engineering sectors ranging from simulating geological processes in planet Earth through to monitoring and controlling electricity consumption in industrial plants over the web. Over that time Python has exploded in popularity from being an obscure scripting language to becoming one of the most popular and widely used language in the world. The growing demand for Python skills reflects it's broad adoption in the diverse realms of web development, data science, cloud operations, and as an embedded scripting language in professional applications. This course is the culmination of our series on the core Python language. We'll cover advanced topics, a knowledge of which will set you apart from the greater number of Python developers. Topics, such as descriptors, we'll learn how to gain fine grain control over attribute access, metaclasses, where you'll see how to intercept class object construction, and virtual subclasses, where you'll discover the subtle but powerful controls Python gives you over class relationships. By the end of this course you'll know enough Python to understand the advanced techniques used to implement sophisticated frameworks, like SQLAlchemy or Django, and be able to bring those capabilities to bear in your own solutions. Before beginning this course you should be familiar with the material we cover in our Python Fundamentals and Python Beyond the Basics courses here on Pluralsight. I hope you'll join me on this journey to expand your core Python 3 language skills with the advanced Python course at Pluralsight.",

      "Building efficient web and mobile interfaces is often challenging and requires the use of imperative logic. React enables you to declaratively describe user interfaces in terms of their state, and it will do the heavy lifting of natively building them for you. In this course, React: Getting Started, you will delve into the fundamental concepts about React and use them to build practical web applications. First, you will see how to design class components and stateful function component, how to one-way flow data and behavior in a component tree, and how to read and update state elements. Then, you will delve into modern JavaScript features used with React like arrow functions, destructuring rest and spread operators, classes, async/await, and more. Next, you will learn some core React tasks like taking input from the user, reading data from an API, managing side effects like timers, and sharing stateful logic with custom hooks. Finally, you will explore how to configure and use a local JavaScript development environment on your machine. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge you need to understand React projects, and start simple React applications from scratch.",

      "Hello everyone. My name is Samer Buna. I work at jsComplete where we create interactive educational content to help people learn coding. Welcome to this React.js: Getting Started course, from Pluralsight, covering the latest stateful function components with the all new React Hooks. React is a simple and powerful library that is used in many big web and mobile applications today. I personally use React in most of the projects I'm involved in. It helps me be fast and productive. In this course, I cover the new, simple way using function components with Hooks, and the other more verbose way, using class components. This is a fully hands‑on course where I'll be building small, practical applications with React. There will be no foo or bar in this course, and I try to avoid contrived examples as much as possible. Learning to code is a practical experience. Try to do and redo the examples I'll present in this course and try to expand their scope and challenge yourself with every piece of knowledge that you learn. Some of the topics that we will cover in this course include React's design concepts, function and class components and their benefits, JSX and event handlers, working with data and APIs, React Hooks for state and side effects, taking input from the user, communicating between components, React one‑way flow of data, and creating your own local development environment for React. By the end of this course, you should be comfortable working with function and class components in React, manage an application state, and be able to build simple React applications from scratch. This course is a beginner‑level course on the React.js library. No previous knowledge about React itself is needed, but you do need to be comfortable with the JavaScript language to get the most out of this course. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn the basics of the excellent React.js library in this Getting Started course, at Pluralsight.",

      "Take a deep dive into full-stack JavaScript with React.js and learn advanced concepts like the context API, HOCs, external state, performance optimization, asynchronous APIs, testing, deployment, and more.",
    transcript:
      "Have you ever wanted to create full-stack Javascript applications with React.js? This course, Advanced React.js, covers many advanced topics and best practices about React.js. First, you'll learn how to configure and customize full-stack JavaScript environments. Next, you'll explore how to work with async data and manage an application state both internally and externally. Additionally, you'll dive into components context API, and learn how to use it with higher order components, pure components, presentational and container components, and all components lifecycle methods. Finally, you'll discover performance analysis and optimization, how to use immutable data structures, and how to create production builds for both React.js and Node.js. By the end of this course, you'll be able to efficiently use presentational and stateful React components in production.",
